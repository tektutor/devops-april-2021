- name: This playbook will install, configure and deploy a custom web page into nginx web server

#   - name: Start nginx web server
#     service: name=nginx state=started enabled=yes
#   Due to a known bug in Ansible, ansible isn't able to start service in Ubuntu docker container.
#   The service module uses 'service nginx start' command in Debian/Ubuntu and 'systemctl start nginx'
#   command in RedHat(systemd) based OS. Since our lab machine is a CentOS box, and service command
#   doesn't seem to know how to manage the service in Ubuntu container. This issue only happens in
#   ansible node containers, and doesn't happen in Cloud based VMs or On-Premise servers, local VMs.
#   As a workaound, let's use shell module to start the service. Shell module is not idempotent.
